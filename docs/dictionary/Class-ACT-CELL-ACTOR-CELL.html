                    The `message-box'. By default the `actor'/`actor-cell' has no message-box.
When the actor is created through the `actor-context' of an actor, or the `actor-system'
then it will be populated with a message-box.

        Description:
    </h2>
    <p>
        `actor-cell' is the base of the `actor'.
It is meant to encapsulate state, but also to execute async operations.
State can be changed by calling into the server via `call' or `cast'.
Where `call' is waiting for a result and `cast' does not.
For each `call' and `cast' handlers must be implemented by subclasses.
    </p>
    <p>
        It uses a `message-box' to processes the received messages.
When the `actor'/`actor-cell' was created ad-hoc (out of the `actor-system'/`actor-context'),
it will not have a message-box and can't process messages.
When the `actor' is created through the `actor-system' or `actor-context',
one can decide what kind of message-box/dispatcher should be used for the new `actor'.
    </p>
    <p>
        See `actor-context' `actor-of' method for more information on this.
    </p>
    <p>
        To stop an `actor' message handling and you can send the `:stop' message 
either via `call' (which will respond with `:stopped') or `cast'.
This is to cleanup thread resources when the Gserver is not needed anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: the `actor-cell' uses `call' and `cast' functions which translate to `ask' and `tell' on the `actor'.
